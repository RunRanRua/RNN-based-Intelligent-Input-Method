# RNN-based Intelligent Input Method
RNN-based Intelligent Input Method is an experimental project that implements a lightweight neural word prediction model for intelligent input methods.
The core objective is to build a simple but effective RNN-based language model that can predict the most probable next words based on the user's current input context.

# Project Goals

Build and train a word-level or character-level RNN language model

Use the model to generate next-word predictions from partial user input

Return the top-N most likely candidate words for real-time suggestion

Provide a minimal prototype demonstrating how IMEs can leverage neural networks for word association and text prediction

This project focuses on learning and experimentation, showing how traditional input method features such as candidate ranking and word association can be achieved using modern deep learning techniques.
